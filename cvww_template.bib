  annote = {Google Maps API combined with Street View images can serve
as a powerful tool for place recognition or city reconstruction tasks.
In this paper, we present a way how to build geotagged datasets of
perspective views from Google Maps. Given the initial GPS coordi-
nates, the algorithm can build a list of panoramas in a certain area,
download corresponding panoramas, and generate perspective views.
In more detail, each panorama on Google Maps Street View contains
meta data from which the GPS location and the direction of the view
can be extracted. Moreover, the information about the neighbouring
panoramas can be obtained as well, hence, a list of panoramas cov-
ering a certain area can be built. Downloading panoramas from the
list and combining it with the meta data, each downloaded panorama
is cut into a set of overlaping perspective views and stored while the
camera GPS location, yaw, and pitch are coded in the filename of the
perspective view. The geotagged database is subsequently used for
place recognition and structure from motion 3D reconstruction.},
